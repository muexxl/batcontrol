"""Scheduler Thread Module

This module provides a scheduler thread that runs alongside the main control loop.
It uses the schedule library to run periodic tasks at specific intervals.

The module exposes global functions for scheduling jobs that can be called from any context:
- schedule_every(): Schedule a job to run at regular intervals
- schedule_at(): Schedule a job to run at a specific time each day
- schedule_once(): Schedule a job to run once at a specific date and time
- clear_jobs(): Clear all scheduled jobs
- get_jobs(): Get all currently scheduled jobs
